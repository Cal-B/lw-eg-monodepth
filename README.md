# lw-eg-monodepth
Light-Weight Edge-Guided Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation

## Create Dataset Link
```
mkdir dataset
ln -s ~/path/to/kitti/ ./dataset/
ln -s ~/path/to/cityscapes/ ./dataset/
```

## Train
```
sh ./bash/bash_train.sh
```

## Evaluation 
We have prepared two bash scripts to evaluate the performance of Kitti and Eigen splits on Kitti dataset. Please change the varaiables in the scripts to run the evaluation. You will get the similar results we have in the paper.
* Example
```
sh ./bash/bash_evaluate_kitti.sh
```
You will recieve the results as shown:
```

* We skip first 10 testing files in the computational efficiency evaluation due to the unstability of first few iterations. 

## Pre-built models

We have prepard the built models for references [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1njgQyNf4Bk5TEQoXzgN4vs31Texi0sxN).
