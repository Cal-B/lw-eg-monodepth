# lw-eg-monodepth
This is the implementation of the paper: Light-Weight Edge-Guided Self-supervised Monocular Depth Estimation [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11705). This work is evolved from the project [Monodepth](https://github.com/mrharicot/monodepth). Please cite our paper if you use our results. Thanks.

## System Requirements
This work is implemented using Tensorflow 1.5, CUDA 10.0, cuDNN 7.6, and anaconda/python 3.7 under Ubuntu 18.04LTS. There may have some warnings from Tensorflow 1.5, but it won't effect the simmulation.  

## Create Dataset Link
Please download the kitti and cityscape dataset and converted the input image to JPEG format in your own path. Then create the link to local directories inside the project as following. 
```
mkdir dataset
ln -s ~/path/to/kitti/ ./dataset/
ln -s ~/path/to/cityscapes/ ./dataset/
```

## Train
We have prepared two bash scripts to train our models on KITTI and Cityscapes dataset. After preparing the dataset, please run bash file as following (Take kitti dataset as example): 
```
sh ./bash/bash_train_kitti.sh
```
Please configurate the model and output file path by your preference.

## Evaluation 
We have prepared two bash scripts to evaluate the performance of Kitti and Eigen splits on Kitti dataset. Please change the varaiables in the scripts to run the evaluation. You will get the similar results we have in the paper.
* Example on vggASPP model with KITTI training result.
```
sh ./bash/bash_evaluate_kitti.sh
```
You will recieve the results as shown:

```
* We skip first 10 testing files in computing FPS due to the unstability of first few iterations. 

## Pre-built models

We have prepard the built models for references [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1njgQyNf4Bk5TEQoXzgN4vs31Texi0sxN).
